Chanllenge 1
	There is a prngtest.c that prints out the generated
pseudo random numbers. We have an array of size 20 and run
PRNG for 1000 times. The range of generated numbers are from
0 to 19 (inclusive). Every time the index of the number is 
generated, the value adds 1. In the end we print out the 
array content. The values are between 30 and 60 and look about
evenly distributed.
	Run xv6 and type prngtest. 
	If needed, you may go into prngtest.c to change the array
size and rerun the test.
