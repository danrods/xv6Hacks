List challenge problems completed as part of the lab 3 handin, as well
as the problem number.  If you worked any previous lab challenges and
submitted them with this lab, list them here, along with the lab number.

Chanllenge 1
	There is a prngtest.c that prints out the generated
pseudo random numbers. We have an array of size 20 and run
PRNG for 1000 times. The range of generated numbers are from
0 to 19 (inclusive). Every time the index of the number is 
generated, the value adds 1. In the end we print out the 
array content. The values are between 30 and 60 and look about
evenly distributed.
	Run xv6 and type prngtest. 
	If needed, you may go into prngtest.c to change the array
size and rerun the test.

Challenge 2
	For the Dynamic switching between Round Robin & Lottery I created a syscall named switchScheduler
	this will switch the scheduler by breaking out of the current scheduler and return to a method which checks 
	the value that gets changed in the syscall and reloads the different scheduler. There is a method called schedSwitch
	in the file schedTest.c  which runs a command in the lottery, switches schedulers and runs the same command.
